    <h2>A Study of <i>Little Nightmares</i> by Tarsier Studios: Sounds and Visualizations for Narrative Development and Devices in the Horror Game</h2>
    <img src="lnm.jpg" alt="lnm">
    <br><i>Little Nightmares</i> follows a small girl in a raincoat who wakes up on a suitcase with no memory in a strange and dark place. 
 Armed only with a deep and insatible hunger, the little girl "Six", must traverse through the immense labyrinth known as "The Maw" 
  looking for any way to escape. During the game's three acts, Six slowly begins uncovering 
  the horrendous truth about The Maw and why her hunger is so unquenchable.</br>
        <br> Everytime instance Six gets hungry in <i>Little Nightmares</i>. Three devices that can always be observed during these occurrences are the deep hunger 
    grumbles, heartbeats, and glassy bell-like sounds. </br>

    <br> As Six's body physically cries out for sustenance, we may attribute Didier Anzieu's theory <i>The Skin Ego</i>. Anzieu states that the cry of hunger 
  is a key fundamental leap in developing communication and language skills. As Six does not speak (note 1).  </br>
       <br> While being chased by the assortment of monsters, each notable encounter is signaled by a rapid heartbeat audible cue. Watch and take notice of the audible cues and how they might 
    elicit apphrension and fear in the player while Six is hunted and subsequently chased by the blind Janitor monster.</br>

    <br> Every chase scene in the game can be described as the <i>"Fort/Da"</i> phenomenon originally observed by Sigmund Freud (note 2). As the recurrent themes of peekaboo
  emerge between the player and the monsters within the Maw, the apprehension and fear felt in the player begin to turn into an compulsion to master the art of running away successfully. </br>
