    <br>Little Nightmares follows a small girl in a raincoat who wakes up on a suitcase with no memory in a strange and dark place. 
 Armed only with a deep and insatible hunger, the little girl "Six", must traverse through the immense labyrinth known as "The Maw" 
  looking for any way to escape. During the game's three acts, Six slowly begins uncovering 
  the horrendous truth about The Maw and why her hunger is so unquenchable.</br>
